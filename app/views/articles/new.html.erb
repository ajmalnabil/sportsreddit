<!-- # When you call form_with, you pass it an identifying scope

# form_with helper what this form is for. Inside the block for this
# method, the FormBuilder object - represented by form - is used to
# build two labels and two text fields, one each for the title and
# text of an article. Finally, a call to submit on the form object
# will create a submit button for the form. -->
